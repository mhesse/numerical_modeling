## Course Description

Covers numerical solution of dynamical problems arising in the solid earth geosciences. Entails development of individual codes in Matlab and application of codes to understanding heat transfer, wave propagation, elastic, and viscous deformations. Requires familiarity with Matlab.

The course content will be guided by a current research problem that typically leads to a scientific publication within the following year. In past classes we have worked on the following problems:

### Matlab basics:
Here are some LiveScripts I prepared for the first class in 2018 that didn't have a Matlab prerequisite. If you donâ€™t have much Matlab experience, please look through them. Vectorized programming is a particularly important topic.

2. [demo_functions.mlx](matlab/demo_functions.mlx) [[pdf]](matlab/demo_functions.pdf)

Below are two files that I have sometimes used for the demos in class. If you put them into the folder with class files you should have no problem.

## This years course project
In spring 2023 we will develop a model for hydrothermal convection in porous media. This has applications to several research problems, including the post impact hydrothermal evolution of the Chicxulub crater and the minig of elements from the silicate interior of asteroisd and moons, in particular Jupiter's moon Europa.
